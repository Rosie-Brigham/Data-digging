# Data-digging
This repository contains scripts and documentation related to analyzing classification data from Zooniverse projects.  Most content is tailored to Panoptes-based Project Builder projects, but there is also some legacy Ouroboros-based code.

## Contents

*docs*: Column descriptions for Panoptes export CSV files.

*scripts_GeneralPython*: This directory holds top-level example scripts that are generally applicable to any project.  These scripts convert a classification data export CSV into more useful formats and data products.  In most cases, these scripts extract information from the compact JSON-formatted “annotations” column data into an easier flat CSV file.

*scripts_ProjectExamples*: This directory holds project-specific subdirectories, each with scripts and data files.

*scripts_Utility*: This directory holds Python scripts for one-off tasks.

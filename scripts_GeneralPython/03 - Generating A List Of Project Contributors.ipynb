    "# Creating a Project Contributor/Collaborator/Author list\n",
    "\n",
    "It's standard practice in Zooniverse projects to acknowledge the contributions of the volunteers in any publication, report, or other kind of description of the results of the project. This can come in many forms, e.g. in the authors section (usually as a footnote) or acknowledgments section of a journal article. There is usually a relatively brief acknowledgment that directs readers to a full list of contributors. This notebook shows you how to use `make_author_list.py` to generate that list. The list is generated in markdown format.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: different projects use different terms to refer to their volunteers, depending on how they interact with them. Commonly used terms (in addition to \"volunteer\") are \"collaborator\", \"author\", and \"contributor\". Many avoid the term \"user\" as it can feel sterile and doesn't really describe the nature of the engagement between project team members (it gets used more often when describing people who make use of software features, for example).* \n"

The quick-and-dirty version used immediately above doesn't do that. It doesn't remove non-live classifications, or duplicates, or separate classifications by workflow. So because it considers all classifications in the example file instead of just the ones in a specific workflow, it's a longer list. \n",
